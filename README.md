# 🪨📄✂️ Stone Paper Scissor Game (Python)

## 📌 About the Project

This is a simple **Stone Paper Scissor** game built using Python.
The user plays against the computer. The computer randomly selects a choice, and the program determines the winner based on the game rules.

This project demonstrates:

* Conditional statements (`if-elif-else`)
* User input handling
* Random number generation
* Basic game logic

---

## 🎮 How the Game Works

The user enters:

* `1` → Stone
* `2` → Paper
* `3` → Scissor

The computer randomly selects one of the three choices.
